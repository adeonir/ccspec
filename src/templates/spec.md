# Feature Specification: {FEATURE_NAME}

**Branch**: {BRANCH_NAME}
**Created**: {DATE}
**Status**: Draft

<!--
## Instructions for Claude Code (Remove this section from final file)
### Execution Flow
1. Parse user description
2. Extract key concepts (actors, actions, data, constraints)
3. Mark unclear aspects with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]
4. Generate user stories
5. Create functional requirements (must be testable)
6. Identify entities if data is involved
7. Run review checklist

### Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Mark all ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
- Remove optional sections that don't apply
- Remove this instruction section from final file

### User Story Format
Write user stories using this structure:
- "As a [user type], I want [goal/action] so that [benefit/value]"
- Focus on different user personas and their specific needs
- Each story should be independently valuable
- Break complex features into multiple simple stories
